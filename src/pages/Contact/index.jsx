                    I have a background in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) with 5 years of work experience in the NC local government sector. I have worked for 
                    three municipalities now - Currituck County as a Development Technician & Planner, Mecklenburg County as a GIS Technician, 
                    and the Town of Indian Trail, NC as a Planner & GIS Coordinator.

                    In the past I've had a strained relationship with coding after a struggle with Python during college; however, I faced my fear at the end of 2019 and completed General
                    Assembly's 10-week Python course. After conquering that, I had the confidence to take on UNC Charlotte's 6-month full-stack Web Development course which I will finish
                    July 12th, 2021. It has been a wild ride, but I feel that I have a great base to build from, as well as a natural inclination towards problem solving, that will make 
                    me an asset on any team.
